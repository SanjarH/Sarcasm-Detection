# CaseStudy - Sarcasm Detection
Here is my first Data Science project about Sarcasm Detection based on Kaggle dataset.

We have a dataset of sarcastic headlines from two news websites. There is each dataset, which consists of three attributes:

    - is_sarcastic: 1 if the dataset is sarcastic, 0 otherwise
    - headline: the headline of the news article
    - article_link: Link to the original news article.
    
We need to find out which news items are sarcastic and which are not.  I solved this problem in two tasks. In 1 task I worked with the following plan:

•	Read and clean the data   
•	Find and visualise most common words   
•	Identify and visualise stop words   
•	Pre-process text   
•	Define classification models  
•	Retrieve and save the best model  

In 2 task I worked with plan bellow:

•	Load and pre-process data  
•	Define the Deep Learning models  
•	Get the best model to solve the problem  
•	Save model.
